# To-Do List (Flask Web App)

This is a simple Flask-based web app for managing a personal to-do list.
It lets you add tasks, assign priorities, and mark them as complete or incomplete.
Tasks are saved to a local JSON file so they persist between sessions.

- Tasks are saved in `tasks.json`
- Clean, browser-based UI
- Light styling with optional color indicators
