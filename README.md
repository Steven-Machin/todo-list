# Console To-Do List App

This is a simple console-based to-do list application written in Python. It lets you add tasks, view your current list, and remove tasks once they’re done. Tasks are saved to a local file so they’re still there the next time you run the program.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Saves tasks to a text file (`tasks.txt`)
- Basic and easy to follow code structure

## File Overview

- `todo.py` — the main script that runs the app
- `tasks.txt` — automatically created file where tasks are stored
- `README.md` — this file

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

2. Run the script:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

## Notes

This project was built as a way to practice basic Python skills, including:
- Reading and writing files
- Working with lists and functions
- Handling user input
- Using version control with Git and GitHub

If you're learning Python, feel free to fork this and expand on it—add due dates, priorities, or even a basic UI.
